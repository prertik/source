Hi folks, I am Pratik Karki known around the internet as prertik. I do good
programming but mostly I do bad programming. Read my blog to know how not to do
programming like me and become better programmer. There's a saying in Chinese
about this but I couldn't understand the words and can't search it over the internet.


tl;dr I am bad developer.
