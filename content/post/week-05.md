Hello everyone,

This week I have been working on migrating small shell scripting component to C builtin. The work will be towards parsing a small modular component so that it can directly be used. With the development of my current patch, the rebase built-in that I will work on can do a super simple rebase.

I might be able to demonstrate something in 2-3 days.

That's a wrap up for this week.
