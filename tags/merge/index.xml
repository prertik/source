      <description>Ok, you&amp;rsquo;ve read my previous Git blog. There were nice feedback in the mailing list and in emails and IRC. This week I did a close study on git-rebase. There are _a_lot_of_posts_ about git-rebase which talk of benefits of rebase and some are negative towards rebase. By convention, it is understood that rebase is harder to understand for beginners that&amp;rsquo;s why most will prefer merging. Even Github has merging of pull requests by default and to do rebase and merge you&amp;rsquo;ll have to select it from the drop-down menu in the pull-requests section.</description>
